## Job Market Paper -- Contagion, network cohesion and long run stability in evolutionary games
This paper studies how the network structure affects the long-run equilibria emerging in coordination games when agents are myopic best responders. Our analysis builds-on the properties of the process of contagion. We demonstrate that when contagion is feasible, the network diameter, a measure of the cohesiveness of the network, determines the uniqueness of long-run equilibria. The maximum group cohesion is one of the network measures that determines the feasibility of contagion. We show that for regular cyclic networks, there exists a threshold network diameter above which strategies in the smallest iterated p-best response set, for p equal to the maximum group cohesion, are uniquely stochastically stable. We discuss how these results can be extended to evolutionary dynamics on arbitrary networks using different network measures that determine the feasibility of contagion.

### Strategic diffusion in networks through contagion (with Théophile T. Azomahou)

We consider an evolutionary game model on finite networks where individuals revise their strategies
over time through best response. Focusing on coordination games, we establish conditions under which a strategy is contagious on a given network (i.e. when it can spread contagiously starting from a small group of players to the entire population, and its associated convention is never invaded by other conventions). We define a measure of contagion threshold for finite networks and show that p-dominant strategies are contagious on networks with a contagion threshold equal or greater than p. We also show that in evolutionary game models where players can make mistakes, there exists a threshold level of experimentation above which contagion is not relevant because it is dominated by noisy dynamics. Above this threshold, targeting individuals to trigger network-wide diffusion is economically unreasonable.

### On the relationship between p-dominance and stochastic stability in network games

This paper studies the long-run (stochastic) stability of an evolutionary model with persistent randomness in network games. We focus on evolutionary dynamics in symmetric coordination games where players choose the best responses to their opponents' strategies. Recent studies find that the network structure determines uniqueness of stochastically stable outcomes in such models. We identify the contagion threshold (i.e. a number below which some strategies can spread contagiously across a network) as one of the aggregate network measures that determines the uniqueness of stochastically stable outcomes. Specifically, we show that strategies that form a p-best response set (i.e. strategies that are best responses to any distribution that places on them a mass of at least p) are uniquely stochastically stable in networks with a contagion threshold equal to p. This result holds for all strongly connected networks with diameter greater or equal to 5.

### Costly word-of-mouth learning in networks (with Théophile T. Azomahou)

This paper develops a framework for word-of-mouth learning in networks where agents strategically decide when to take an irreversible action. Agents face a trade-off between taking an irreversible action early enough to avoid the cost of waiting and waiting to receive more information to increase confidence in their choice. We characterize equilibrium exit times and establish conditions for correct learning in large societies. The necessary conditions for correct learning are: (i) no single or small group of agents should have unbounded influence as measured by conditional in-degree; (ii) The underlying network must have a bounded diameter. Finally, we show that the presence of noise in signals prolongs exit times, and hence increases the likelihood of asymptotic learning.

### How central agents affect group behaviour and the speed of learning

Centralized network structures, which consist of at least one actor – a central agent – whose behaviour is observed by the rest of the group are predominant across social, political and economic settings. In public and corporate sectors, central agents such as managers and CEOs, shape organizational culture and identity, which in turn affects organizational performance. This paper studies how central agents affect behaviour formation through social learning. We show that although central agents play a crucial role in driving the group to a consensus, they do not necessarily exert the most influence on the group’s equilibrium behaviour. In equilibrium, an agent’s influence corresponds to her eigenvector centrality. We also examine the convergence rate of behaviour formation and show that it depends on the degree to which central agents facilitate group cohesion.

### Prejudice, group cohesion and the dynamics of disagreement

This paper studies how individual prejudice – a set of preconceived and inflexible opinions – and group cohesion generate everlasting public disagreement in models of learning by averaging. We consider an endogenous model of opinion formation where agents compromise between respecting their own personal prejudice and conforming to the opinions held by others with whom they share close ties. We quantify the extent of equilibrium disagreement and show that its magnitude increases with the intensities of prejudice and group cohesion. Similarly, the speed of learning is a logarithmic function of the intensities of prejudice and group cohesion.

### Informal Intellectual Collaboration with Central Colleagues (with Co-Pierre Georg and Michael E. Rose)

When preparing a research article, academics engage in informal intellectual collaboration by asking their colleagues for feedback. This collaboration gives rise to a social network between academics. We study whether informal intellectual collaboration with an academic who is more central in this social network results in a research article having higher scientific impact. To address the well-known reflection problem in estimating network effects, we use the assignment of discussants at NBER summer institutes as a quasi-natural experiment. We show that manuscripts discussed by a discussant with a 10% higher than average Bonacich centrality rank results in 1.4% more citations and a 5% higher probability that an article is published in a top journal. To illustrate our results, we develop a structural model in which a positive externality from intellectual collaboration implies that collaborating with a more central colleague results in larger scientific impact of the research article.

## New: Just completed

### Discussants (with Co-Pierre Georg and Michael E. Rose)
This study is the first to examine the role of discussants in academic knowledge production. Comparing articles of similar quality with and without discussants, we find that having a discussant increases a paper’s probability of publication in prestigious journals, but not its citation count. Conditional on having a discussant, citation count and probability of publication in a prestigious journal increase in the discussants’ prolificness. This supports the existence of a quality channel through which discussants improve the inherent quality of a paper. Conversely, we do not find evidence for the existence of a diffusion channel whereby papers garner more citations because discussants diffuse information about the paper within their social network.

## Ongoing projects

### Information percolation in exit games (working paper coming soon)
Timing is an important component of many economic and investment decisions. When faced with uncertainty regarding the rewards from available options, agents may seek information from their peers to inform their decisions. This paper develops a framework of information exchange through social learning. Although waiting to receive information from peers improves the accuracy of decision, there may be material losses associated with waiting. Agents strategies thus involve choosing an optimal time to stop waiting for information and take an action (e.g. make an investment).  We examine how the architecture of the underlying interaction structure influences stopping times. We find that neighbourhood centrality, a network measure of the number of an agent's neighbours within a given radius, determines stopping times. Specifically, centrally placed agents (with higher neighbourhood centrality) have shorter stopping times, while peripheral (in the network) agents have longer stopping times. This framework helps explain empirical observation regarding correlations in investment decisions within and not across regions.
